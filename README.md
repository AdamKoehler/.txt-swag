# .txt-swag
.txt file management. This can be tweaked and used at large scale to organize any .txt data.
For this example I used football.
I have three seasons worth of football games in text files with no particular order.
Lets say I want to merge these three seasons into one list and sort the order of teams lexicographically so that my team is easy to find.
So for this example I just sorted by name but theres so many ways this can be used with a few changes.
This can be tweaked and used to sort scores, names, or any .txt data if the cpp file is tweaked.
I included three seasons and the final merge sorted list so that you can see an example.
