# .txt-swag
.txt file management. This can be tweaked and used at large scale to organize any .txt data.
For this example I used football.
I have three seasons worth of football games in text files with no particular order.
Lets say I want to merge these three seasons into one list and sort the order of teams lexicographically so that my team is easy to find.
So for this example I just sorted by name but theres so many ways this can be used with a few changes.
I included three seasons and the final merge sorted list so that you can see an example.

Just change the struct to define what you are searching for in a file. change the read order so that the pattern is appropriate for your file. change the algorithm to do whatever you need and then specify your pathing for input and output and you can easily change a large amount of files without deleting any original file data.
